# The aim of this project is to explore the number and geographic distribution of Ukrainian refugees in Ireland since 2022. 
# I will use Python to create:
# 1. Dataframes with the number of Ukrainian refugees in a given area;
# 2. a geographic plot of the top 5 counties by number of refugees hosted.

# First I will import a CSO dataset on the number of Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in each Local Electoral Area in Ireland in 2022 in XLSX format:
ukraine_arrivals_county_xlsx  = pd.read_excel(r"C:\Users\andyb\OneDrive\Documents\Ukraine Arrivals 2022.xlsx", sheet_name = "No. of arrivals")
ua_df1 = pd.DataFrame(ukraine_arrivals_county_xlsx)
ua_df1.head()

# Note that the data in this table is cumulative; the figure in each LEA for each successive month includes the previous figures from previous months.


# In[42]:


# I will filter by December 12th to get the latest figure for each LEA
mask1 = ua_df1["Day"].str.contains("2022 December 12")
ua_df1[mask1].head()


# In[43]:


# Next, I will import another sheet from the same XLSX file with the number of Ukrainian refugees in each LEA as a percentage of the population:
ukraine_arrivals_percentage_of_pop_xlsx  = pd.read_excel(r"C:\Users\andyb\OneDrive\Documents\Ukraine Arrivals 2022.xlsx", sheet_name = "Arrivals as % of Pop")
ua_df2 = pd.DataFrame(ukraine_arrivals_percentage_of_pop_xlsx)


# In[44]:


# I will filter by December 12th to get the latest figure for each LEA
mask2 = ua_df2["Day"].str.contains("2022 December 12")
ua_df2[mask2].head()


# In[45]:


# I will now merge these tables 
ua_arrivals_overview = pd.merge(ua_df1, ua_df2)
ua_arrivals_overview.dropna()
ua_arrivals_overview.loc[(ua_arrivals_overview["County"] == "Kerry") & (ua_arrivals_overview["Day"] == "2022 December 12")]


# In[46]:


mask3 = ua_arrivals_overview["Day"].str.contains("2022 December 12")
ua_arrivals_overview[mask3].loc[:]


# In[18]:


grouped_counties = ua_arrivals_overview[mask3].groupby(["Day", "County"]).sum("No. of people")
ua_arrivals_overview_grouped = pd.DataFrame(grouped_counties)
ua_arrivals_overview_grouped.loc[:]


# In[65]:


# I'll drop those columns in the middle; I'm not sure how they appeared, but they're adding no value:

# The Kenmare entry for Kerry appears to be missing, so that will need to be appended. A bigger problem is that the percentages have been summed, giving incorrect figures. 
# The percentage figures are for each LEA rather than the county as a whole and so cannot be summed.
#I will correct this now by dropping the percentage column from this DataFrame:
ua_arrivals_overview_people_only = ua_arrivals_overview_grouped.drop(columns = "Percentage (%) of Population")
ua_arrivals_overview_people_only.loc[:]


# In[72]:


# Now to append the value for Kerry by replacing 4743 with 6493 (4743 + 1750 which is the missing total no. of arrivals in Kenmare):

# Now I'm going to create a chart for the top 5 counties by number of Ukrainians living there (Dublin, Kerry, Cork, Donegal, and Galway). 
# First, I need to create a dictionary for each county with the number of Ukrainians living there in each month.
# For this use case, I feel that it's qucker to pull the numbers from Excel, and I also want to demonstrate converting a dictionary into a chart;
# Therefore, I will simpply copy the numbers into my dictionaries:

# In[74]:


# I can now use Dublin as a template to quickly create the other dictionaries:

# The map plot further helps visualise the geographic distribution of refugees hosted among the top 5 counties in 2022.

# It's interesting that Kerry overtook Cork in 2nd place between October and November; why is this?
# I suspect it could be due to the availability of holiday homes, as Kerry has a large number of these.
# Holiday homes are typically vacant in the winter months and thus could potentially be used for temporary refugee accommodation, so this could be an explanation.
# To investigate, I will create a DataFrame with these 5 counties and the number of vacant holiday homes in each from May-December 2022.
# I will then create a plot with this data, similar to above, and see what I find.
# Of course, correlation does not equal causation, so I will have to corroborate any such finding with other sources.

# Perfect! Interesting to see that Donegal actually had the most number of unoccupied holiday homes in 2022. 
# This makes sense, since Donegal is a popular holiday destination in the summer but not as desirable for year-round residency.
# This is due to the unforgiving climate in winter, geographic isolation, underdeveloped infrastructure, and lack of economic opportunities.
# Based on these factors, one wonders if it is suitable long-term to accommodate refugees there.

# Back to the original question behind this data, Kerry did indeed have more unoccupied holiday homes than Cork in 2022.
# Kerry is another popular summer destination that's less desirable year-round for similar reasons to Donegal.
# I suspect that West Galway (i.e. Connemara) and West Cork account for the majority of unoccupied holiday homes in those counties.

# Kerry, Donegal, West Galway, and West Cork account for the most holiday homes in Ireland for the following reasons:
# Famous natural beauty,e.g. beaches and mountains
# A climate that can be pleasant in summer but harsh in winter, discouraging some people from year-round residency in favour of summer residency in holiday homes.
# Geographic isolation, including underdeveloped infrastructure
# The result of these factors is a large seasonal summer population in each county.

# These factors also beg the question of the suitability of holiday homes for long-term accommodation of refugees.
# Refugees need a wide range of supports, e.g. access to social welfare infrastructure, public transport, schools for children, and English language lessons for adults.
# These are generally less abundant in areas with large numbers of holiday homes, due to the seasonal nature of the population size.
# Jobs are also less abundant.
# All of these factors pose challenges for successful accommodation of refugees in these areas, and possible integration if that is their wish.
